  <h1>Introduction</h1>
  <p>
    To trace the mechanics of a Python while loop, we wrote a very basic script
    that involves incrementing a counter a few times in a while loop. The code
    is as follows:
  </p>

  <pre><code>
    x = 1
    y = 5
    while x < y:
    	x += 1
  </code></pre>

The disassembled code is as follows:  
  <pre><code>
  1           0 LOAD_CONST               0 (1)
              3 STORE_NAME               0 (x)

  2           6 LOAD_CONST               1 (5)
              9 STORE_NAME               1 (y)

  3          12 SETUP_LOOP              26 (to 41)
        >>   15 LOAD_NAME                0 (x)
             18 LOAD_NAME                1 (y)
             21 COMPARE_OP               0 (<)
             24 POP_JUMP_IF_FALSE       40

  4          27 LOAD_NAME                0 (x)
             30 LOAD_CONST               0 (1)
             33 INPLACE_ADD         
             34 STORE_NAME               0 (x)
             37 JUMP_ABSOLUTE           15
        >>   40 POP_BLOCK           
        >>   41 LOAD_CONST               2 (None)
             44 RETURN_VALUE        
  </code></pre>
  <p>
  Most if not all of those opcodes should look very familiar, as they have been covered
  either in class or in previous assignments. The bytes that make up the core of the 
  while loop functionality range from byte 12 to byte 40. The other byte codes are trivial
  value and name management and program exit.

<h1>NEED A NAME HERE LOL</h1>
  <h2>SETUP_LOOP</h2>
  <p>
    As you might be able to recall, SETUP_LOOP is defined in ceval.c and has the following
    key line of code, which is defined in frameobject.c:

  <pre><code>
    PyFrame_BlockSetup(f, opcode, INSTR_OFFSET() + oparg, STACK_LEVEL());
  </code></pre>

  <p>
  The arguments passed in are as follows:
  "f" is the frame object
  "opcode" ends up being the "type" of block that gets set up
  "INSTR_OFFSET() + oparg" ends up being used as the "handler", which is basically where to
  jump to when the block is popped.
  "STACK_LEVEL()" is the level of the value stack to jump to once the block is popped
  </p>

  <p>
    PyFrame_BlockSetup() does a quick block stack overflow check to make sure that the new
    block is allowed to exist by checking the current block number count, which is stored 
   in the f_iblock field of the PyFrameObject struct, against the constant CO_MAXBLOCKS
   defined in code.h, which is set to 20. If there are no problems, the a new block gets
   added to the block stack (f_blockstack[]) that the frame object f keeps track of and
   its fields are set to the corresponding arguments passed in.
  </p>

  <h2>COMPARE_OP</h2>

  <p>
  Hopefully, you remember the COMPARE_OP mechanism well enough, but we'll briefly go over
  it here.
  The top value, in our case, y, is popped off and the next value, in our case, x, is peeked
  at to obtain its value. Once both values are obtained, Python checks to see if they're 
  integers (and they are):
  <pre><code>
            if (PyInt_CheckExact(w) && PyInt_CheckExact(v)) {
                /* INLINE: cmp(int, int) */
                register long a, b;
                register int res;
                a = PyInt_AS_LONG(v);
                b = PyInt_AS_LONG(w);
                switch (oparg) {
                ...
                }
            }
            ...
  </code></pre>
  <p>
  This is because comparing integers is really quick. Comparing integers involves
  putting the two numbers through the addition hardware circuit in the ALU. The second number is
  negated by flipping all of its bits and adding 1 to effectively convert to subtraction. The system
  can then determine the outcome of the comparision from the registry flags that are raised after the
  subraction. Python ends up converting the two numbers to longs to prevent potential overflow.
  Python handles the integer comparison via a switch statement to see which compare operation
  should be run and then runs it on the two longs and spits back the result as a Python boolean
  (Py_True or Py_False).
  </p>
  <p>
  To finish up, COMPARE_OP replaces the top value on the stack with the result and predicts a
  POP_JUMP_IF_FALSE oparg to come next.
  </p>

<h2>INPLACE_ADD</h2>
<p>
  The setup for this is very similar to COMPARE_OP: the top value is popped off and the next value
  is peeked at. Python then checks to see if they are integers (which they are) before converting
  them to longs and running basic addition. The interesting part is after the addition is finished,
  we see a bitwise xor check between the sum (i) and the two numbers added (a and b):
</p>

<pre><code>
if ((i^a) < 0 && (i^b) < 0)
</code></pre>

<p>
This is to check for overflow because even 64-bit integers can overflow. There are two cases in
which the addition can overflow: both numbers are positive or both numbers are negative.
In the positive case, under normal circumstances, two numbers added should produce a larger, but
still positive number, meaning that the highest-order bit is 0. So when xor'd with positive numbers,
the resulting number should remain positive. If the result ends up being negative, then xor would
toggle both a and b's highest-order bit from 0 to 1, which would instantly convert it to a negative
number. If that happens, then we know for a fact that the operation overflowed.
</p>
<p>
In the negative case, under normal circumstances, two negative number should produce a larger
negative number. Thus, when xor'd with a and b, i, if it remains negative, would toggle a and b's
highest-order bit to 0, which would instantly convert them to positive numbers and thus pass the
< 0 test. Otherwise, if it overflows, the 65th bit would be chopped off due to the convention of
two's complement numbers and the highest order bit would be a 0, so a and b's highest order bits
would remain 1 and fail the < 0 test.
</p>
<p>
Beyond that, our script would just exit the if with i casted to int, complete some book keeping with
reference counters, replace the top of the stack with the value of i and continue.
</p>

<h1>CONTROL FLOW</h1>
<p>
The while loop control flow is dominated by two opcodes: POP_JUMP_IF_FALSE and JUMP_ABSOLUTE.
Since you are very familiar with this, I'll go over them only briefly.
</p>

<h2>POP_JUMP_IF_FALSE</h2>
<p>
POP_JUMP_IF_FALSE is usually predicted with <code>PREDICT(POP_JUMP_IF_FALSE);</code>
like in COMPARE_OP. In our case, this opcode handles when the while condition is false and needs to
jump to the end of the block. The general mechanics are quite simple: if the value at the top of the
stack is "Py_True", then keep going with the next opcode. Otherwise, jump to the byte that is specified
in the oparg. In our case, it jumps to byte 40, which is POP_BLOCK.
</p>

<h2>JUMP_ABSOLUTE</h2>
<p>
This happens at the end of the tryblock to jump back to the while loop's conditional. It jumps to the
byte specified with the oparg.
</p>

<h1>CLEAN UP</h1>

<h2>POP_BLOCK</h2>
<p>
Pops off the block with <code>PyFrame_BlockPop()</code>, which is defined in frameobject.c. This basically reverses
what <code>PyFrame_BlockSetup()</code> does, including a stack underflow check to make sure the stack count doesn't
go below 0.
</p>
<p>
All other opargs are trivial.
